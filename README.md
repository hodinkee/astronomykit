# AstronomyKit

AstronomyKit works with [AA+](http://www.naughter.com/aa.html) to provide Objective-C and Swift API for performing complex calculations about the solar system.

## Installation

AstronomyKit works best with [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage).

You may also integrate the framework into your project directly.
